 KidneyQuest - Project Summary

  What it is: A browser-based side-scrolling jump game (think Chrome's dinosaur game) starring the CeRKiD zebra mascot.  
  The zebra runs through a kidney-themed world collecting genes and avoiding obstacles.

  Context: CeRKiD = Center for Rare Kidney Diseases at Charite Berlin (Halbritter Lab). The zebra is the rare disease    
  mascot (because rare diseases are "zebras, not horses").

  Purpose: Teaching tool for the AI-Teachathon workshop. Participants practice the full Git workflow (fork, clone,       
  branch, code with AI, commit, push, PR) on a real project.

  Tech stack: Deliberately simple - vanilla HTML5 Canvas, vanilla JavaScript, zero dependencies. Just open index.html in 
  a browser and it runs. No build tools, no frameworks.

  Repo: github.com/berntpopp/KidneyQuest

  Gameplay: Side-scrolling runner where the zebra character jumps over obstacles and collects genes. Scoring increases   
  the longer you survive / more genes you collect.

  Planned features / issue ideas for workshop participants:
  - Adding obstacles
  - Improving jump physics
  - Creating new backgrounds (cloud parallax)
  - Adding a score counter
  - Scoreboard displaying genes collected
  - Obstacle collision detection

  Key constraint: Must stay vanilla JS - no libraries - so non-technical workshop participants can understand the code   
  and modify it with AI assistance.
